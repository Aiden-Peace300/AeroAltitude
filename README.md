# Drone Services Website 🚁

This is a professional drone service website built using **React**, **Typescript**, **Node.js**, and **CSS**, blending my background in computer science with my passion for being a drone pilot. The site provides an overview of drone-related services, pricing, and a direct contact option for quotes.

## 🌟 About the Project

As a certified drone pilot and developer, I wanted to create a platform that reflects both my technical skills and my love for aerial photography and data capture. This site is the result of that effort — an elegant and responsive single-page application that offers:

- A dynamic UI with mobile navigation
- Clear breakdowns of service offerings and pricing
- Smooth user interaction using React state management
- Integrated PDF brochure and social links
- Quote request form and contact section

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, CSS Modules, Font Awesome, React Icons
- **Backend:** Node.js (planned for expansion with backend integrations)
- **Assets:** Custom logo, downloadable PDF, styled components

## 📁 Features

- Mobile responsive navigation menu
- Service overview with categorized pricing
- Quote form with email popup logic
- Social media integration (LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Reusable components: `Footer`, `Welcome`, `OverviewOfServices`, `Prices`, `GetQuote`

## 🧠 Developer Insight

This project is not just a portfolio piece — it's the first step in launching my drone services business. It demonstrates my ability to apply practical programming skills to real-world entrepreneurship.

## 🔗 Live Preview

_Coming soon — hosted deployment in progress._

## 📄 Future Improvements

- Backend integration with Node.js + Express for handling contact form submissions
